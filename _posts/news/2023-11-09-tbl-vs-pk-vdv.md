As the Black League marches forward from their previous defeat and humiliation during the Insurgents War of July, they
are now fully prepared for a war against two new factions that have recently joined the Military War Tycoon â€“ the
Peacekeepers [PK] and the Russian Airborne Forces [VDV].

## Backstory

- PK decided to join MWT after being blacklisted in WT for a three-month period. VDV, who had long-standing
  disagreements with The Black League, formed an alliance with PK and also made their way to MWT. **No one believes that
  they're hosting MWT events.**

- The Black League, led by Arnav, formerly known as Dmitry Yazov, is keenly aware of the presence of VDV and PK in
  Military War Tycoon. Fearing actions such as server raids and blacklist attempts that could potentially threaten The
  Black League's position, Arnav has now **readied his faction for a monumental conflict against both PK and VDV**,
  aptly named **"The Great Trial."**

However, it appears that both the owner of the Peacekeepers, known as **Edwin_Legends**, and the owner of VDV, known as
**Mate1126**, are somewhat dismissive of the impending war.
