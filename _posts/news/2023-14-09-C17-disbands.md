ComSeventeen (C17), has officially disbanded. This news comes as Razor, C17's Project Manager, has mentioned that he attempted to recruit more staff but failed, also believing that there is little interest for other MWT community members to join, and that he lacks the motivation to further pursue C17.

## What would happen after disbanding?
As per Razor's statements:
- Channels like "External topics" will be moved to The Combine
- ComSeventeen may return to FE like it was before, or it will simply stay archived and never come back.
- Another thing he mentioned was "Combine will shutdown too idk"
