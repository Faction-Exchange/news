An official announcement was made by Commander Ghost220, declaring that Converted Tactical Operations (CTO) is no longer operational. This decision stems from a lack of activity and Ghost220's inability to effectively lead due to the demands of their college commitments.

## What will happen to CTO in the Map lore?
Ghost220 mentioned that she would give away CTO's territories, Including Alaska to **H.E.C.U** owned by **HECU guy**. Ghost220 expressed strong trust in HECU guy during an interview, underlining this decision.

## What would be the aftermath since CTO is gone?
The CTO's disbandment is expected to have several consequences:
- The Peacekeepers will no longer have the CTO as backup in the event of war with the Black League (TBL).
- TBL's aggression over Alaska in the map lore is likely to escalate.
- Many factions are anticipated to fight for control over CTO's land.

## The Interview

**Arnav**
1. What was the reason behind disbanding the CTO?
2. What would a diplomat or CTO member's reaction be to the dismantling of the CTO according to you?
3. As you mentioned in your announcement, why are you giving CTO's territories, including Alaska, to H.E.C.U?
4. Which person do you think would be happy about this and which person would be sad?
5. How do you feel now that the CTO has been disbanded?

**Ghost220**
1. The reason CTO was disbanded is because of activity, and I've ran out of time to really command the group due to college.
2. Diplomat/member probably wouldn't care to much.
3. I'm giving territory to HECU because the leader of the faction is a person I'd trust to do good with the land.
4. GROM would be happy abt this most likely. Nobody would be sad tbh.
5. I feel more released, relaxed and less stressed.
