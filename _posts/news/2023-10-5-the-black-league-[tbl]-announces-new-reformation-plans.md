In a recent development, <:TBL:1148626126097367040> The Black League [TBL] showcased a renewed determination to evolve and reform itself. Despite the [earlier announcement of the faction disbanding](https://faction-exchange.github.io/news/factions/2023/10/04/tbl-disbands.html), a committed trio has come forth to advocate for the continuation and growth of The Black League:
- OrganisedChaos
- Dmitry Yazov (Arnav)
- Alexander Lazarenko (lans-exe)

## Key Objectives

1. **Restructuring and a Focus on MWT **
   The reformers will be restructuring TBL, focusing on streamlining efforts and resources, including shifting attention away from Blackhawk Rescue Mission 5 (BHRM5), potentitally establishing a separate faction.
2. **Membership Purge**
   TBL has plans to streamline its member base, retaining its most committed members while aiming to keep above 70 people in the faction, maintaining a Quality over Quantity approach.

## Additional Reformations

- TBL Bot undergoing a significant overhaul
- Merging the Military Police [MP] within the central server
- Revival of the Federal Security Service [FSB] 
- Temporary invite pause until the reform is successful
