Yesterday, at approximately 3 October 2023 22:00 GMT +1, one of MWT's longest standing factions announced its
forthcoming disbandment, making the end of an era.

TBL's founder and leader, Arnav, displayed his most heartfelt emotions in an announcement to the member of the TBL,
thanking both allies, and adversaries alike, and acknowledging friendships forged, and challengers faced and overcome
through The Black League's journey, lasting 8 months.

Arnav's final demand was to engage in a conflit with Sierra PMC, and to eradicate their presence within MWT.

## About The Black League

TBL was founded 8 months ago by Arnav, and welcomes players of all skill levels, fostering a sense of brothership, and
camaraderie, valuing their partnerships with other factions within MWT.

## What's next?

If you want to follow Arnav, and the engineering marvel that is TBL Moderation Bot, you can
join [The Cadente Federation](https://discord.gg/KzUwgQdSXT), "a brand new faction that works similar to how a coalition
would work".
